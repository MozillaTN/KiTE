**Hello Everyone**

<p>It's an immense pleasure in welcoming you all for the women's day celebration at KGiSL Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>I feel very glad to reach out to the Women's and extempore the ideas and contributions of MOZILLA .</p>

<p>The agenda for the Women's day celebration would be as follows.</p>

<p>13.00 - 14.00: Presentation on Women in Technology</p>
<p>14.00 - 14.30:  Introduction to various tracks</p>
<p>14.30 - 16.30: Hands on session on testing</p>

<p>we hope that this day would certainly lead womens to actively contribute to Mozilla and would benifit the best out of the day.</p>
